Unfortunately, we are not finished yet with our final report.
First we thougth, having too less participants for our study at a certain point of time, we could ask for an extension of the deadline. Also providing us with more time to figure out a schedule that works for every team member. Due to some personal issues and little excursions some group members made, combined with the fact that the laptop of the person responsible for the main analysis part did not work, we are not completely finished yet, as we thougth we could send the final report somewhen around the 23th. Moreover, we did not completely understand the analysis yet, but tried to make that clear in the first draft of our final report.

As we will earliest meet at the 22nd July, we apoligize that our very final report will be earliest send at the 23th July, latest 23:59.
