### Experiment
Since we gathered all the necessary data for our analysis (thanks everyone for participating!) we took the experiment offline. You can still open the experiment via the Netlify link (https://mental-imagery.netlify.com/) or open it locally using the index.html, but your data will not be collected anymore and will not count towards our analyses. <br/> Have fun! 


### Structure of our Repository
We are aware of the fact, that our repository is not well structured. We encountered a problem: Netlify did not recognize our index.html if it was not located at our root directory. In order to host the experiment online, we had to move it in the root directory. Sorry for the messy folder structure.
