### Experiment
Since we gathered all the necessary data for our analysis (thanks everyone for participating!) we took the experiment offline. You can still open the experiment via the Netlify link (https://mental-imagery.netlify.com/) or open it locally using the index.html, but your data will not be collected anymore and will not count towards our analyses. <br/> Have fun!
